Why These Topics are Crucial: Pre calculus is a deep dive into functions: You'll
analyze polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric
functions in much greater detail. Strong algebraic manipulation skills are
essential for simplifying, solving, and transforming these functions.

Calculus relies heavily on algebraic fluency: When you get to calculus, you'll
be performing operations like differentiation and integration. The calculus part
is often just one step; the rest of the problem is usually pure algebra â€“
simplifying expressions, factoring, solving equations, and understanding
functions. If your algebra is weak, it will hinder your ability to focus on the
new calculus concepts.

Trigonometry (the other half of pre calculus) uses algebra extensively: Solving
trigonometric equations, working with identities, and graphing trigonometric
functions all require solid algebraic skills.

Recommendation for your Python/Markdown Library:

As you build your library, focus on creating clear Python functions for each of
these algebraic operations and then use Markdown to explain the mathematical
theory, provide examples, and show how your Python code implements those
concepts. This iterative process of explaining, coding, and testing will
solidify your understanding more than simply reading a textbook. Good luck!
