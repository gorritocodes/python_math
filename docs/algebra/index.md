# Core Algebraic Manipulations & Concepts

## Numbers and Operations:

-   Real Number System: Understanding integers, rational numbers, irrational
    numbers, and their properties.

-   Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Essential for accurate calculations.

-   Fractions and Decimals: Confident manipulation (addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, division, simplifying).

-   Absolute Value: Definition and solving equations/inequalities involving
    absolute value.

-   Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities:

-   Simplifying Algebraic Expressions: Combining like terms, distributive
    property.

-   Solving Linear Equations: In one or more variables.

-   Solving Linear Inequalities: And representing solutions on a number line or
    interval notation.

-   Solving Systems of Linear Equations: Using substitution, elimination, and
    graphing.

## Quadratic Equations:

-   Factoring: Various methods (GCF, grouping, difference of squares,trinomial).

-   Quadratic Formula: Knowing it, using it, and understanding the discriminant.

-   Completing the Square: For solving and converting to vertex form.

-   Graphing Parabolas: Understanding vertex, axis of symmetry, intercepts.

## Exponents and Radicals:

-   Laws of Exponents: Product rule, quotient rule, power rule, negative
    exponents, zero exponent.

-   Rational Exponents: Converting between radical and exponential forms.

-   Simplifying Radicals: Square roots, cube roots, etc.

-   Rationalizing Denominators: With single terms and binomials (conjugates).

## Polynomials:

-   Operations with Polynomials: Addition, subtraction, multiplication
    (including FOIL, special products), and division (long division and
    synthetic division).

-   Factoring Polynomials: Beyond quadratics (e.g., sum/difference of cubes, by
    grouping, higher degrees).

-   Zeros/Roots of Polynomials: Understanding the connection between roots,
    factors, and x-intercepts.

-   Graphing Basic Polynomials: General shapes of x n.

## Rational Expressions:

-   Simplifying Rational Expressions: Factoring numerator and denominator.

-   Operations with Rational Expressions: Addition, subtraction (finding common
    denominators), multiplication, division.

-   Solving Rational Equations: Identifying excluded values.
