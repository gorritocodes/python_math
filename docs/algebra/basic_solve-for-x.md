# Solve for X

When you try to find the value of $`x`$, you'll try to fin operations to both
sides of the equality, to get to an operation where $`x = \text{something}`$ and
by doing that you'll end up finding the value of **$`x`$**.

Let's see an example with **addition**:

```math
x + 3 = 5 \\[1em]
\text{ We subtract } -3 \text{ to both operands to preserve the equality}\\[1em]
x -\not{3} +\not{3} = 5 {- 3} \\[1em]
x = 2
```

Here's another example with **subtraction**:

```math
x -2 = 10 \\[1em]
\text{ we add} +2 \text{to both operands to preserve the equality}\\[1em]
x - \not{2} + \not{2} = 10 +2 \\[1em]
x = 12

```

Here's another example with **multiplication**:

```math
3x = 12 \\[1em]
\text{ we divide both operands by}  3 \text{ to preserve the equality}\\[1em]
\frac{\not{3}x}{\not{3}} = \frac{12}{3}\\[1em]
x = 4
```

Here's another example with **division**:

```math
\frac{x}{4} = 2\\[1em]
\text{ we multiply both operands by } 4 \text{to preserve the equality}\\[1em]
\frac{x}{\not{4}} \times {\not{4}} = 2 \times 4 \\[1em]
x = 8
```
