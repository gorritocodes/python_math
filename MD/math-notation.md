# Math Notation

this is for me to learn how to write mah notation in Markdown.

## White Space

```math
\text{this is a way to express regular text. is very useful for unit notations} \\
\text{to write the equivalent of an 'enter' you'll use doble inverted / you can also add brackets with a measurement to add more space.  }
```

## Operators

### addition

$`2 + 2 = 4`$

### subtraction

$`3 - 3 = 0`$

### multiplication

$`3\times 4 = 12`$

### division

$`1 / 2 = 0.5` \\
1 \div 2 = 0.5`$

$`\frac{1}{2} = 0.5`$

$`3 = 3 true `$

$`4 < 5 `$

$`4 \le 5`$

$`4 \ge 5`$

$`4 > 5`$

$``$ $``$ $``$ $``$
